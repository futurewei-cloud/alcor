== Overview

In this document, we outline the performance test plan for Alcor SDN Control Plane and the performance comparison with
OpenStack Neutron - the de facto networking control plane for OpenStack-based cloud.
This test plan details test environment, tools, system monitoring and most importantly, test cases against Alcor and Neutron.
The test cases includes a set of established test cases offered by Rally, which is an open-source performance test framework,
as well as new test cases customized for public cloud scenarios.

This test plan covers an ongoing effort to cover the most important cloud operations in terms of networking performance,
starting with network, subnet and ports.
We will continue to extend the coverage including routers, security groups and other networking objects.

== Test Environment

This section includes preparation and details of our test environment including hardware speficiation of servers,
network parameters, operation system and perf test tools.

== Test Cases

=== Test Case 1: Basic Alcor Test Suite

The following Rally test scenarios need to be executed:

- create-and-list-networks
- create-and-list-subnets
- create-and-list-ports
- create-and-delete-networks
- create-and-delete-subnets
- create-and-delete-ports
- create-and-update-networks
- create-and-update-subnets
- create-and-update-ports

Test Cases to be supported in E2E is enabled:

- create-and-list-routers
- create-and-list-security-groups
- create-and-list-floating-ips
- create-and-delete-routers
- create-and-delete-security-groups
- create-and-delete-floating-ips
- create-and-update-routers
- create-and-update-security-groups

Performance Metrics

=== Test Case 2: Stressful Alcor Test Suite
