== Overview

In this document, we outline the performance test plan for Alcor SDN Control Plane and the performance comparison with
OpenStack Neutron - the de facto networking control plane for OpenStack-based cloud.
This test plan details test environment, tools, system monitoring and most importantly, test cases against Alcor and Neutron.
The test cases includes a set of established test cases offered by Rally, which is an open-source performance test framework
and benchmarking tool, as well as new test cases customized for public cloud scenarios.

To ensure fair comparison between Alcor and Neutron, the following setup is proposed:

- Same set of controller nodes will be used for Neutron control plane and Alcor control plane.
When one control plane is under test, the other will be completely turned off.
- Same set of compute nodes will be used to host VMs and customer workloads.
- Same benchmarking tool and test cases will be used to conduct the performance test.
- Same set of metrics to measure the performance and scalability of a system.

This test plan covers an ongoing effort to cover the most important cloud operations in terms of networking performance,
starting with network, subnet and ports.
We will continue to extend the coverage including routers, security groups and other networking objects.

== Test Environment

This section includes preparation and details of our test environment including hardware specification of servers,
network parameters, operation system and perf test tools.

=== Overall Setup

Our performance test environment contains 3 types of servers:

- controller nodes: hosting both OpenStack control plane and Alcor control plane
- compute node: Hosting VMs and customer workload
- rally node: Hosting Perf test tool

=== Benchmarking Tool

As mentioned, Rally is an open-source benchmarking tool that was designed specifically for OpenStack API testing,
benchmarking and profiling.
It established a number of mature test suites for various OpenStack components, and we leverage its Neutron test suites
(refer to Section <<Test-cases>>)
Also, we will customize a few new test cases that are designed for Public Cloud env.


== Test Metrics and Strategy

In the test, we adopt three metrics <<openstack_perf>> to measure the performance and scalability for Alcor.

- Operation Latency - the duration of performing a single operation in a single thread -
min/max/average/median/90% tail/95% tail/99% tail latency will be collected
- Operation Throughput - the average number of operations completed in one second -
- Concurrency - the number of parallel operations when the operation throughput reaches its maximum.

We will measure the scale impact by comparing the above metrics in different test setups, which vary in one or more dimensions.

- Number of network resources including network, subnet, ports, security groups etc. In the current environment,
we will stree test the system by scaling up to 10,000 ports (~500 ports/node).
- Combination of various resource size, for example a limited number of large networks (each with 1,000 ports),
a few median-sized networks (each with 100 ports), and a larger number of small networks (each with 10 ports).
- Scale up and down of Alcor control palne with various replicas of microservice instances and db instances.

We will show operation latency and throughput number for each scenario, and use curve to see the changing trend.
