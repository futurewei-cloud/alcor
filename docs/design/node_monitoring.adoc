// == Introduction

// TBD...

== Architectural Design

* Architectural diagram

== Node Health Model

* Agent health and heartbeats
1. Host Netdata will monitor all Host Agents heartbeat very second, notify node manager directly through gRPC if there is issue with one or more Host Agent.
2. Host Netdata heartbeat to node manager freqently (e.g. every a few seconds) through gRPC or Kafka.
3. Host Netdata archive heartbeat data to prometheus (e.g. every 5 seconds) for longer term storage and viewing in Grafana.

* Option 1: Configure Netdata to monitor target processes, below is a sample configuration file
[source]
------------------------------------------------------------
template: aca_running
families: *
      on: apps.processes
  lookup: min -1s unaligned of kubelet
   units: processes
   every: 1s
    crit: $this == nan
    info: check if aca is running
   delay: down 5s multiplier 2 max 10m
      to: sysadmin
------------------------------------------------------------

* Option 2: use Monit as process monitoring manager, use the available Monit plugin from Netdata to pull data from Monit.
** Monit can provide a more powerful and richer capability to launch/monitor/relanch process/daemon.

== Detection and Handling of Node Failure

* Key workflow between different components

== Detection of gRPC Queue Full

== Detection and Recovery of Resource Provisioning Failure

* VPC/Subnet/Port/Security Group etc..
* What happen if dataplane programming failed? The error will propagate back to VPC controller and it should notify compute about the VM/Container setup failure. Compute should move on and pick another host.

== Tenant VMs/Containers Health

Tenant VMs/Containers Health will be monitored in two ways:

1. The VM runtime or container runtime can provide information or hooks to expose VM/container status like state (stopped/running/paused) and device status (NIC disconnected/connection/paused). This is linux runtime dependent and does not require customer opt-in. This data can be streamed to host netdata without customer involvement.

2. Customer can opt-into a 3rd party monitoring solution or opt into our Netdata solution. Once they enable Netdata for VM/container monitoring, the tenant Netdata will stream data to host netdata for quick analysis and archive to prometheus.

// == Summary

// do we need it?

== Proposed Changes

The Node Monitoring system would requires the following changes:
