= Alcor Regional Controller Design

//== Project Scope

== High-Level Architecture

image::images/controller.JPG["Controller architecture", width=1024, link="images/controller.JPG"]

=== Design Principles

* Regional Scope, AZ resilience
* Simple network resource abstraction
* Loosely coupled components for flexible partitioning and easy scale out
* Top-down configuration driving towards eventual consistency
* Decoupling among services
** Database access only through service
** Isolation of database access and cache on the service level
** Enable flexible partitioning for various services

== Micro-Service Framework

. One controller instance is one Kubernetes application
. One microservice is one Kubernetes service
. One microservice could consist of multiple service instances (stateless or stateful) to improve availability, scalability and performance

=== Concurrency and Event Ordering

Four types of concurrent network resource update:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|====================
|Concurrent Event Types|Example|Approach

| Operation on decoupled resources
| CURD of resources under two different/unpeered VPCs
| Free to update simultaneously

| Operation on loosely relevant resources
| Add one port, and delete the other in the same subnet
a|
- No conflict on resource management
- Network conf programming: Network conf versioning + version-awareness at ACA

| Operation on directly coupled resources
| Delete a VPC and create a subnet for an empty VPC
a|
- Timestamp issued by API gateway
- Check associated resource status
- DB cleanup for unstaged transactions

| Operation on the same resource
| Update operation and delete operation on the same port
a|
- Customer experience: may have different experience if executed in different order
- Resource management: no conflict (using DB concurrency + timestamp versioning)
- Network configuration programming: no conflict

//== Design Proposals
//
//=== Proposal A: Database centric design
//
//OpenStack
//Various business logics (implemented via plugin) access to the same database.
//Each service accesses to SQL database with DAO/ADO library.
//
//=== Proposal B: API server centric design
//
//Kubenetes
//Various business logics access to one (partitioned) database through API services.
//
//=== Proposal C: Service centric design
//
//Service mesh
//
//=== Proposal Comparison & Decision
//
//[width="100%",options="header"]
//|====================
//|Design|Pros|Cons
//|Option 1: Database centric design |Business logic coupling causing maintainence/upgrade challenges, business intra-interference and deep database coupling |
//|Option 2: API server centric design | | Simplied database access by standard API calls
//|Option 3: Service centric design| |
