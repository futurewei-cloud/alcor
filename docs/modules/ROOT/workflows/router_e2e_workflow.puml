===Scenarios A: Create GREEN subnet P1 on Host 1, then RED subnet P2 on Host 2, both subnets connected to same router==

==Scenario A1: Setup GREEN subnet P1 on Host 1 ==
autonumber 10
"Port Manager" -> "Route Manager": Query routing info and connected subnets {GREEN subnet id, vpc id}
"Route Manager" -> "Port Manager": Response {routerinfo(connected to GREEN subnet)\n Subnetids(the list of connected subnets including GREEN subnet)}
"Port Manager" -> "Node Manager": Get node info input: {host_id}, new port\n output: {host_ip, local_host_dvr_mac (new)}
"Port Manager" -> "Node Manager": Get node info input: {host_id}, L3 neighbor\n output {neighbor host_ip} May merge with above
"Port Manager" -> "Data Plane Manager": POST /port sync with RequestBody NetworkConfiguration=\n {[P1 port w/ L2_neighbor_Id=NULL \n L3_neighbor_Id=NULL],[GREEN Subnet],[VPC],[SG]}
"Data Plane Manager" -> "ACA on \n Host 1": Port: CREATE (FULL) P1\n DHCP: CREATE (FULL) P1, Subnet: INFO

==Scenario A2: Setup RED subnet P2 on Host 2 ==
autonumber 20
"Port Manager" -> "Route Manager": Query routing info and connected subnets {RED subnet id, vpc id}
"Route Manager" -> "Port Manager": Response {routerinfo(connected to RED subnet)\n Subnetids(the list of connected subnets including RED subnet)}
"Port Manager" -> "Node Manager": Get node info input: {host_id}, new port\n output: {host_ip, local_host_dvr_mac (new)}
"Port Manager" -> "Node Manager": Get node info input: {host_id}, L3 neighbor\n output {neighbor host_ip} May merge with above
"Port Manager" -> "Data Plane Manager": POST /port sync with RequestBody NetworkConfiguration=\n {[P2 port w/ L2_neighbor_Id=NULL \n L3_neighbor_Id=[P1]],[Router INFO][GREEN+RED Subnet],[VPC],[SG]}
"Data Plane Manager" -> "ACA on \n Host 2": Port: CREATE (FULL) P2\n DHCP: CREATE (FULL) P2\n L3 neighbors CREATE (DELTA) P1 + Router: INFO \n (w/ host 2 local DVR mac), Subnet: INFO (GREEN+RED)

==Scenario A3: Setup L3 neighbor about RED subnet P2 on Host 1 ==
"Data Plane Manager" -> "ACA on \n Host 1": L3 neighbors CREATE (DELTA) P2 + Router: INFO\n (w/ host 1 local DVR mac), Subnet: INFO (RED+GREEN needed for router)


===Scenarios B: (Neutron only) Create GREEN subnet P1 on Host 1, then RED subnet P2 on Host 2, GREEN and RED subnets NOT connected until after P1 and P2 is created==

==Scenario B1: Setup GREEN subnet P1 on Host 1 ==
autonumber 30
"Port Manager" -> "Route Manager": Query routing info and connected subnets {GREEN subnet id, vpc id}
"Route Manager" -> "Port Manager": Response {routerinfo(connected to GREEN subnet),\n Subnetids(the list of connected subnets including GREEN subnet)}\n Should return none
"Port Manager" -> "Node Manager": Get node info input: {host_id}, new port \n output: {host_ip, local_host_dvr_mac (new)}
"Port Manager" -> "Node Manager": Get node info input: {host_id}, L3 neighbor \n output {neighbor host_ip} May merge with above
"Port Manager" -> "Data Plane Manager": POST /port sync with RequestBody NetworkConfiguration=\n {[P1 port w/ L2_neighbor_Id=NULL \n L3_neighbor_Id=NULL],[GREEN Subnet],[VPC],[SG]}
"Data Plane Manager" -> "ACA on \n Host 1": Port: CREATE (FULL) P1, \n DHCP: CREATE (FULL) P1\n Subnet: INFO (GREEN only)

==Scenario B2: Setup RED subnet P2 on Host 2 ==
autonumber 40
"Port Manager" -> "Route Manager": Query routing info and connected subnets {RED subnet id, vpc id}
"Route Manager" -> "Port Manager": Response {routerinfo(connected to RED subnet)\n Subnetids(the list of connected subnets including RED subnet)}\n Should return none
"Port Manager" -> "Node Manager": Get node info input: {host_id}, new port\n output: {host_ip, local_host_dvr_mac (new)}

"Data Plane Manager" -> "ACA on \n Host 2": Port: CREATE (FULL) P2\n DHCP: CREATE (FULL) P2\n Subnet: INFO (RED only)

==Scenario B3: Router created and connected GREEN + RED subnet together ==
autonumber 50
"Customer" -> "Route Manager": Create new router
"Customer" -> "Route Manager": Connect GREEN subnet\n to new router
"Route Manager" -> "Subnet Manager": Update router ID for GREEN subnet
"Customer" -> "Route Manager": Connect RED subnet\n to new router
"Route Manager" -> "Subnet Manager": Update router ID for RED subnet
"Route Manager" -> "Port Manager": Update L3 Neighbor
"Port Manager" -> "Node Manager": Get node info input: {host_id}, new port\n output: {host_ip, local_host_dvr_mac (new)}
"Port Manager" -> "Node Manager": Get node info input: {host_id}, L3 neighbor\n output {neighbor host_ip} May merge with above
"Port Manager" -> "Data Plane Manager": POST /port sync with RequestBody NetworkConfiguration=\n {[Neighbor port Id=[P1,P2]],[Router INFO][GREEN+RED Subnet],[VPC],[SG]} 
"Data Plane Manager" -> "ACA on \n Host 1": L3 neighbors CREATE (DELTA) P2 + Router: INFO\n (w/ host 1 local DVR mac), Subnet: INFO (RED+GREEN needed for router)
"Data Plane Manager" -> "ACA on \n Host 2": L3 neighbors CREATE (DELTA) P1 + Router: INFO\n (w/ host 2 local DVR mac), Subnet: INFO (RED+GREEN needed for router)


===Scenario C: (VPC only) Routing rule added for GREEN subnet, GREEN subnet P1 on Host 1, RED subnet P2 on Host 2  ==
autonumber 60
"Customer" -> "Route Manager": Existing router created with GREEN and RED subnet connected
"Customer" -> "Route Manager": Add routing rule on GREEN subnet\n customer provide subnet ID
"Route Manager" -> "Subnet Manager": For new routing rule like new external routing rule\n (new) send GREEN subnet level routing rule to subnet manager
"Subnet Manager" -> "Subnet Manager": Look at all the ports in GREEN subnet\n Look up cache for their {host_ip,\n local_host_dvr_mac (not needed)}
"Subnet Manager" -> "Data Plane Manager": For all the involved host which has GREEN subnet port, Update router info\n which includes the new routing rule on GREEN subnet
"Data Plane Manager" -> "ACA on \n Host 1": Router: INFO (add new routing rule on GREEN subnet)\n Subnet: INFO (GREEN needed for router)
