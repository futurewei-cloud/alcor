NOTE: This revision includes only the new API.
NOTE: The Network Control Manager (NCM) design doc is under review and has not been merged to master. Once it is merged, the link to that document will be active.

== Overview

The Node Metadata Manager is a control plane component responsible for managing and configuring physical servers/nodes/hosts inside a data center. NMM also acts as an interface to register, unregister the new service Network Configuration Manager (NCM). NMM also interacts with Data Plane Manager (DPM) service. Node Metadata Manager is referred to as NMM in this and other documents.

It maintains the detailed configuration for each node and collect its health state continuously in a configurable interval.
The node health states could be used collectively in many user scenarios, for example, to determine if a deployment of network resource (for example, port) is successful, or if a load balancing backend is reachable.

A user with administrator privileges is assumed to exist (Admin user or just Admin). The Admin interacts with Alcor controller (NodeController/NMM) through an API to register, un-register, query, and update node metadata entries.

NMM API is being extended to manage the registration of a new service xref:network_config_manager.adoc[Network Configuration Manager] (NCM). The new API allow creation, deletion, updating and querying of metadata about NCM entities. An NCM is identified by an ID and a URI. The administrator is responsible to provide a URI for the new NCM being added. There is a provision to specify the maximum number of nodes an NCM is expected to handle, also provided by the Admin.

=== User Cases

* Port manager talks to node manager to pull node details from a node id (UUID).
* Register a new NCM: This request is only valid if the NCM is not already up and running. It is an error to try to register more than one NCM with same URI.

NMM will validate the request, update it's NCM entries (ncm_id, ncm_uri pair), and send the same to DPM. The newly generated unique NCM ID will be returned to the caller.

* Query about an NCM: Given an NCM ID, return all information about it. Presently, just the URI and Capacity. In the future, there may be information about how many nodes are assigned to it, and other interesting pieces of information as part of the results.

* Delete an NCM: Given an NCM ID, delete its entries from Alcor system. It may not be an error if the given NCM doesn't exist, or already being deleted.

** Questions:
. How to handle deletion of an NCM if there are come nodes still associated with it?

. How to tell if the given NCM is still processing some network operation when trying to delete it?

..  NMM could maintain currently active node for each NCM to detect this condition. Another possiblity is to let NCM return an error if the NCM has active nodes. NCM may need to maintain some kind of status information apart from active node count, such as ACTIVE/INACTIVE/MAINTAINANCE/REPAIRING.

There was a design discussion (2021/03/21) about these questions and while there may be a need to provide further clarifications, it was concluded that the reader/writer locks would ensure internal consistency of relevant metadata but the operation may raise an error. Locks here do not mean actual locks but the transactional facilities supported by the underlying data store.

* Update NCM: At present the only property of an NCM which can be updated is it's URI. NMM will have to make sure the new URI is not a duplicate of existing NCM before making the change. NPM will send the change to DPM (so that DPM can update it's own mappings)

== Service Requirements

=== Basic Requirements

[arabic]
. Manage mapping from node id to node info (including IP, mac, veth)
. Populating the node mapping in the controller launch time (through a configuration file) during new region or data center buildout
. Expose a CURD API to register, update, or delete a node.
. Define a health model, data schema and APIs for node health
. Working together with other services including port manager.
. Require HA and high scalability as 100,000+ nodes could upload health data continuously.

=== Advanced Requirements

[arabic]
. Node info extensible to more node resources including FPGA etc.
. Fall back mechanism when a node state is stall (e.g. proactively pull instead of waiting for agent to push)

== Node Manager Microservice Design

=== NCM Information
Information required to implement the action may depend on the type fo the request but will include either a URI, or ID or both.

* Create/Register operations will require a URI and will return the corresponding ID.
* Delete and query requests will need the ID of the target NCM.
* Update request will need the ID and the new URI.
* Add a new node to an existing NCM will include the node information and the NCM ID.
* List all members of the NCM partition will need no other information.

=== Architecture Overview
This is an overview of the design and implmentation of the proposed API extensions.

NMM already supports creation and management of nodes. The extension adds NCM information to the node information. Node creation will procede as usual but the association between a node and the NCM is the new addition.

Presently NMM has a repository called NodeRepository which maps nodeid to the information about it (NodeId -> NodeInfo). Since operations on and interactions with NCM are tied to NCM Id, it will be necessary to maintain a second repository. The new repository is called NmmNcmRepository and will map NcmId to NodeInfo and Ncm URI.

class NmmNcmRepository {
   String ncmId;    // KEY
   NcmInfo  ncmInfo;
   NodeInfo nodeInfo;
}

==== NMM algorithms
Some operations here list NMM interactions with DPM but not all. They will be included later. In all of it's operations, if part of the operation failks, NMM will effectively undo any changes made as part of the operation. Rollback doen't mean actully undoing some changes but to depend on the underlying data store facilities. It is possible that NMM will have an internal status information to track the progress of the operation to help it undo any local (in memory) changes and undo them in case of a failure.

===== Node Creation
** NMM will extract NCM information from the NodeInfo object.
** Verify that such an NCM exists and adding this node will not exceed the declared capacity of the NCM.
** Notify DPM about the node creation.
** Notify the NCM about the node being added to its pool of nodes.
** Update the NmmNcmRepository in NMM if NCM operation is success.

===== Node deletion
** NMM will notify the NCM from which the node is being removed.
** Notify DPM of the node deletion.
** If NCM and DPM successfully delete the node, update NmmNcmRepository.

===== Node update
At this time the only update supported is chamging the URI. Again the question of how to handle an active URI being changed comes up and it will have to be managed with the help of the underlying data store and internal status information.

** NMM will notify NCM of the URI change and update it's metadata.

DPM may not be invloved in this operation.

== Database Data Schema

== REST APIs
The NcmUri in the examples below appear to be derived from the nodeid and some port number but this is not the case. NcmUri, as noted earlier, is going to be provided by the Admin and NcmId may be a UUID, generated by NMM.
