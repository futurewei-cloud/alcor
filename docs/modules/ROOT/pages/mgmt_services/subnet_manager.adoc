== Overview

The Subnet Manager is an Alcor microservice which manages the life cycle of all Subnets.
Its responsibilities include but are not limited to creating, updating, deleting, and searching a resource model of a subnet.
It needs to interact with VPC Manager, Route Manager, Port Manager, Mac manager, IP manager to create subnet.
It also needs to dispatch routing update information from Route Manager to Distributed Virtual Routers in corresponding ACAs.

== Service Requirements

[arabic]
. Provide Subnet related operations for VPC, such as subnet creation, updating, deletion and query.
. Maintain information for all related ports of each subnet, including id, ip address, mac address, host ip address and host mac address.
. Concurrency control mechanism should be provided to process multiple concurrent subnet creation requests.
. Process routing rules from Route manager and dispatch routing rules updating messages to DPM and ACA.
. Algorithm with random, but less conflict possibility.
. Fall back mechanism if there is a conflict among creation of subnet.
. Working together with other services including VPC manager, Route manager, Port Manager.

== Design

=== Service Architecture
Subnet Manager handles subnet resource management under a VPC and subnet level routing rules updating.
It needs to interact with Route Manager, Port Manager and Data Plane Manager. The major functionalities
and architecture of Subnet Manager as follows:

==== The relation between Subnet Manager and other managers

=== Key Workflow

==== Subnet level routing rules update
image::subnet_manager_routing_rules_update_architecture.PNG[]

=== Contracts between Subnet Manager, Port Manager and Data Plane Manager
image::subnet_manager_subnet_ports_mapping.PNG[]

=== Concurrency Control

To handle concurrent Subnet creationg requests, the following three things should be considered:

====== (1) Uniqueness
The resources which is allocated to subnet should be unique when there are concurrent subnet creation requests.

====== (2) Fallback
In case for subnet creation fails, the resources (include route info, ip address, mac address) that it has allocated to the subnet should be released.

=== Pub-sub point-to-point channel and sidecar cache pattern
* Subnet Manager maintains subnet-ports mapping and keep tracking the updating of port information,
including port-id, port-ip, port-mac, host-id and host-ip (refer to *SubnetPorts* entity in Data Schema).
* The input data for subnet-ports mapping comes from Port Manager when there is a port updating event occur.
We use a pub-sub model to maintain a point-to-point one way channel between Subnet Manager and Port Manager.
Whenever a port update event triggered in port Manager, the Port Manager needs to post updating message (*UpdatePorts*) to the channel.
* Subnet Manager as a subscriber to receive the port updating message and update the *SubnetPorts* entity in the cache.
* The cache is implemented as a container attached to each Subnet Manager instance as a sidecar in the same POD.
All sidecar caches are created as a cluster and synchronize the cache content all the time.

* Request: `/project/{projectid}/subnets, /v4/{projectid}/subnets`
* Request Parameter: `@PathVariable String projectid, @RequestBody SubnetWebJson resource`
* Operation: Create a Subnet based on user's input.
** If both *gateway_ip* and *allocation_pools* are empty, this function needs automatically generate allocation_pools
based on the input *cidr* and ask Port Manager to create a gateway port using .4 ip address.
** If input body includes *gateway_ip*, this function needs to call Port Manager to create a port using
the specified ip.

ask Route Manage to create a routetable for the specified subnet.

overlap with the allocation pools; otherwise, the call returns the *Conflict (409)* response code.
