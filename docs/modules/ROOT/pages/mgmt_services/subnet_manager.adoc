== Overview

The Subnet Manager is an Alcor microservice which manages the life cycle of all Subnets.
Its responsibilities include but are not limited to creating, updating, deleting, and searching a resource model of a subnet.
It needs to interact with VPC Manager, Route Manager, Port Manager, Mac manager, IP manager to create subnet.
It also needs to dispatch routing update information from Route Manager to Distributed Virtual Routers in corresponding ACAs.

== Service Requirements

[arabic]
. Provide Subnet related operations for VPC, such as subnet creation, updating, deletion and query.
. Maintain information for all related ports of each subnet, including id, ip address, mac address, host ip address and host mac address.
. Concurrency control mechanism should be provided to process multiple concurrent subnet creation requests.
. Process routing rules from Route manager and dispatch routing rules updating messages to DPM and ACA.
. Algorithm with random, but less conflict possibility.
. Fall back mechanism if there is a conflict among creation of subnet.
. Working together with other services including VPC manager, Route manager, Port Manager.

== Design

=== Service Architecture
Subnet Manager handles the resource management for a subnet related resources under a VPC, such as subnet ID,
gateway information, dns nameservers, ip addresses allocation pool, and subnet level host routes.
Subnet Manager needs to interact with Route Manager, Port Manager and Data Plane Manager. The major functionalities
and architecture of Subnet Manager as follows:

The major functionalities of Subnet Manager include:

1. Maintain Subnet Entity information updating
2. Handle Subnet routing rules updating
3. Handle Subnet Gateway port updating

=== Key Workflow

==== Subnet routing rules update
Routing rules update can be initiated by three APIs:

1. Neutron routers add or remove extra routes
2. Neutron subnet's host routes update
3. Subnet's routing table update in a VPC

The following figure shows how workflows for these three APIs call:

==== Gateway port update
When a subnet created, user can assign a custom gateway IP address or use subnet's default gateway IP address.
User can also update gateway IP address anytime. Subnet Manager needs to send request to Port Manager for
the gateway port updating.

The following figure shows the workflow from Subnet Manager to Port Manager when there is a gateway port updating:

=== Cache and contract design

==== Option 1

image::subnet_manager_subnet_ports_mapping.PNG[]

* Subnet Manager maintains subnet-ports mapping and keep tracking the information update for a port,
including port-id, port-ip, port-mac, host-id and host-ip (refer to *SubnetPorts* entity in Data Schema).
* The input data for subnet-ports mapping comes from Port Manager when there is a port updating event occur.
This option uses a pub-sub model to maintain a point-to-point one way channel between Subnet Manager and Port Manager.
Whenever a port update event triggered in port Manager, the Port Manager needs to post updating message (*UpdatePorts*) to the channel.
* Subnet Manager as a subscriber to receive the port updating message and update the *SubnetPorts* entity in the cache.
* The cache is implemented as a container attached to each Subnet Manager instance as a sidecar in the same POD.
All sidecar caches are created as a cluster and synchronize the cache content all the time.
* This option requires a dedicated channel between Subnet Manager and Port Manager for the subnet, port and host mapping information update.
* Subnet Manager also need to maintain extra structure to hold subnet, port and host information.

==== Option 2
* A better option is to create a cache on Data Plane Manager to hold subnet, port and host mapping information.
* The cache is responsible for maintaining _subnet-port-host_ mapping and _nodeID-nodeInfo_ mapping with hashmap:
** HashMap<subnet_id, HashMap<port_id, host_id>>
** HashMap<node_id, NODEINFO>
* The _subnet-port-host_ mapping information comes from Port Manager when there is L2/L3 neighbor information update.
So, the cache should always contain the most updated information.
* The _nodeID-nodeInfo_ mapping information comes from Node Manager when Data Plane Manager needs the information.

image::subnet_manager_mapping_cache.PNG[]

The cache can be implemented in two places:

* As an ignite cache on PM. PM has subnet-port-host persistent information, but DPM needs to ask PM to provide the mappings.
It easily makes PM overloaded.
* As an ignite cache on DPM. DPM is the crossroad for service layer and all agents on each compute node.
Therefore, DPM is the beat place to maintain the host-related mapping information.
* The cache capacity estimation:
** If we have 50 ports/subnet, 2M subnets, and each port-mapping requires 20Byte memory,
then the total size of port-mapping information requires 50 x 2M subnets = 100M x 20Byte  = 2GB.
** If we have 1M hosts, each host requires 200Byte memory,
the total size of node info requires 200 x 1M = 200MB.

=== Concurrency Control

To handle concurrent Subnet creationg requests, the following three things should be considered:

====== (1) Uniqueness
The resources which is allocated to subnet should be unique when there are concurrent subnet creation requests.

====== (2) Fallback
In case for subnet creation fails, the resources (include route info, ip address, mac address) that it has allocated to the subnet should be released.
