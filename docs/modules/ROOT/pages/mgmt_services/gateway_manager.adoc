NOTE: This document is under development

== Overview
The Gateway Manager is an Alcor microservice which manages the internal gateway and external gateway resources for a VPC.
The external gateways are responsible for forwarding traffic to/from external networks, such as another VPC, Internet, on-premise datacenter.
The external gateway including Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, VPN Gateway and Transit Gateway.
The internal gateway handles internal traffic within a VPC. Zeta Gateway is the only internal gateway in the current Gateway Manager.
Gateway Manager's responsibilities include but are not limited to create, update, delete, and search gateway resources for VPC.
It interacts with VPC Manager, Port Manager, Data Plane Manager, and Gateway Clusters.

== Service Requirements
[arabic]
. Manage different types of gateways for a VPC, including internal and external gateways, such as Zeta Gateway, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, VPN Gateway and Transit Gateway.
. Expose CURD APIs to register, update, query and delete VPC's gateway mappings.
. Define a health model, data schema and APIs for the health status of gateway resources.
. Working together with other services including VPC, Route, Port, Data Plane managers.
. Rollback is supported when CRUD operation occurs exception or the exceptions from gateway resources.
