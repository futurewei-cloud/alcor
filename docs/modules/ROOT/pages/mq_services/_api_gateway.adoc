# API Gateway

NOTE: This document is under development

An API Gateway is a server that is the single entry point into the system.
//The API Gateway encapsulates the internal system architecture and provides an API that is tailored to each client.
//It might have other responsibilities such as authentication, monitoring, load balancing,
//caching, request shaping and management, and static response handling.
//
//The API Gateway is responsible for request routing, composition, and protocol translation.
//All requests from clients first go through the API Gateway. It then routes requests to the appropriate microservice.
//The API Gateway will often handle a request by invoking multiple microservices and aggregating the results.
//It can translate between web protocols such as HTTP and WebSocket and web‑unfriendly protocols that are used internally.
//
//It typically exposes a coarse‑grained API for mobile clients.
//Consider, for example, the product details scenario.
//The API Gateway can provide an endpoint (/productdetails?productid=xxx) that enables a mobile client to retrieve all of the product details with a single request.

== Overview

The API Gateway is responsible for request routing, composition, and protocol translation.
//It provides each of the application’s clients with a custom API.
//The API Gateway can also mask failures in the backend services by returning cached or default data.
//In the next article in the series, we will look at communication between services.
//
//They are a type of proxy server that sits in front of your API and performs functionality such as authentication,
//rate limiting, routing publicly accessible endpoints to the appropriate microservice,
//load balancing across multiple internal services, among other things.
//
//Benefits using API gateways are:
//
//. Manage API keys for developers, including providing a consistent way of authorization and authentication
//. Rate limiting and billing which can be quota or usage based.
//. Providing a developer portal for customers and partners to create API tokens, deprecate tokens, etc.

== Benefits
//- A major benefit of using an API Gateway is that it encapsulates the internal structure of the application.
//Rather than having to invoke specific services, clients simply talk to the gateway.
//The API Gateway provides each kind of client with a specific API.
//This reduces the number of round trips between the client and application.
//It also simplifies the client code.

== Drawbacks
//- It is yet another highly available component that must be developed, deployed, and managed.
//- Developers must update the API Gateway in order to expose each microservice’s endpoints.
//It is important that the process for updating the API Gateway be as lightweight as possible.
//Otherwise, developers will be forced to wait in line in order to update the gateway.

== Requirements

//Manage authentication, access control, load balancing requests, caching responses,
//and provides application‑aware health checks and monitoring.

== Performance and Scalability
//The performance and scalability of the API Gateway is usually very important.
//It makes sense, therefore, to build the API Gateway on a platform that supports asynchronous, nonblocking I/O.
//
//- On the JVM you can use one of the NIO‑based frameworks such Netty, Vertx, Spring Reactor, or JBoss Undertow.
//- One popular non‑JVM option is Node.js, which is a platform built on Chrome’s JavaScript engine.
//- Another option is to use NGINX Plus.
//NGINX Plus offers a mature, scalable, high‑performance web server and reverse proxy that is easily deployed, configured, and programmed

== Using a Reactive Programming Model

//- Simple case: The API Gateway handles some requests by simply routing them to the appropriate backend service.
//- Aggregated case: It handles other requests by invoking multiple backend services and aggregating the results.
//. If the requests to backend services are independent of one another,
//the API Gateway should perform independent requests concurrently in order to minimize response time.
//. When there are dependencies between requests, the API Gateway might first need to validate the request by calling an authentication service,
//before routing the request to a backend service.
//
//A much better approach is to write API Gateway code in a declarative style using a reactive approach.
//
//- Examples of reactive abstractions include Future in Scala, CompletableFuture in Java 8, and Promise in JavaScript.

== Service Invocation

//A microservices‑based application is a distributed system and must use an inter‑process communication mechanism.
//There are two styles of inter‑process communication.
//
//. One option is to use an asynchronous, messaging‑based mechanism. Some implementations use a message broker such as JMS or AMQP.
//Others, such as Zeromq, are brokerless and the services communicate directly.
//. The other style of inter‑process communication is a synchronous mechanism such as HTTP or Thrift. A system will typically use both asynchronous and synchronous styles.

== Service Discovery

//determining the location of an application service is not so easy.
//Application services have dynamically assigned locations.
//Also, the set of instances of a service changes dynamically because of autoscaling and upgrades.
//Consequently, the API Gateway, like any other service client in the system, needs to use the system’s service discovery mechanism:
//either Server‑Side Discovery or Client‑Side Discovery.

== Handling Partial Failures
//Another issue you have to address when implementing an API Gateway is the problem of partial failure.
//This issue arises in all distributed systems whenever one service calls another service that is either responding slowly or is unavailable.
//
//How to handle failure => The API gateway should return an error to the client, or return cached data in Redis.
//By returning either default data or cached data, the API Gateway ensures that system failures don't impact the user experience.

=== Circuit Breaker Pattern

//It implements a circuit breaker pattern, which stops the client from waiting needlessly for an unresponsive service.
//If the error rate for a service exceeds a specified threshold, Hystrix trips the circuit breaker and
//all requests will fail immediately for a specified period of time.
//Hystrix lets you define a fallback action when a request fails, such as reading from a cache or returning a default value.

== Option
//- Netflix Hystrix:
//It is an incredibly useful library for writing code that invokes remote services.
//Hystrix times out calls that exceed the specified threshold.
//It implements a circuit breaker pattern, which stops the client from waiting needlessly for an unresponsive service.
