== Overview

OpenStack allows users to launch VM instance via Horizon Dashboard or run nova boot command via OpenStack CLI.
When it occurs, Nova compute would trigger a few REST calls to Neutron to allocate necessary network resources.
We would want to integrate with Nova to support the same set of user operations, especially the vm creation scenario.

== Integration Requirements

. Identify all necessary changes (configuration and/or codes) in Nova to call Alcor REST APIs, instead of Neutron APIs
. Make a proposal that requires minimal Nova changes
. Implement the code/configuration change
. Deploy and test the change in a multi-node OpenStack cluster
