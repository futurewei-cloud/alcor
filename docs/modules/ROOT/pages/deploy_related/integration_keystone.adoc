NOTE: This document is under development

== Overview

Alcor API currently requires a project id in the API Url.Neutron 2.0 APIs, however, don't need to provide a project id as
it generates the project id based on the Authentication token in the X-Auth-Token request header, when Keystone is enabled.

Reference: https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/network/v2/
"The Networking API v2.0 uses the OpenStack Identity service as the default authentication service.
When Keystone is enabled, users that submit requests to the OpenStack Networking service must provide an authentication
token in X-Auth-Token request header. You obtain the token by authenticating to the Keystone endpoint.

When Keystone is enabled, the project_id attribute is not required in create requests
because the project ID is derived from the authentication token."

[#system-requirements]
== Integration Requirements

. Identify Neutron's algorithm that generates project id based on X-Auth-Token.
. Make changes to API Gateway to support Authentication & Authorization with KeyStone, and support same way how project id is generated based on X-Auth-Token in API Gateway.
. Integration testing with KeyStone.

== Review of OpenStack Workflow
https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/identity/v3/index.html#check-token[Openstack keystone apis]

In openstack neutron project, it use keystonemiddle to verify request token. .
Verify request token have few steps.

. get available keystone endpoints from keystone server
. request local token from keystone server with keystone client conf in neutron.conf
. verify request token from keystone server

== Required Changes

. Add a KeystoneAuthWebFilter class to fetch all api-gateway request token and verify token from keystone server and get project_id from verify api response.
. Add keystone conf in application.properties file (https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/user/supported_clients.html[keystone config example])

== Token Cache Design
Consider multi customer requests have a same token, it's not need to send a request to keystone to verfiy the same token for every request.
A cache component can cache all verified token. Alcor will check cache first that the customer request token is verifed,
it will return token info if cache have the customer token. If the customer token not in cache , it will send a request to keystone
and check response and cache the token result.


A cache data have a expired time to clear no use cache tokens.And Double the token expiration as the cache expiration time.
This can prevent customer request from still carrying expired tokens for verification.

== Data Schema
How token store in cache： +
A cache token key is token self. +
A token entity include: +
. string token: a token self +
. date expireAt: the date which token expire at +
. string user: the token user name  +
. string userId: the token user id +
. string domainId: the token user domain id +
. string domainName: the token user domain name +
. string projectName: the token project name +
. string projectId: the token project id +
. string projectDomain: the token project domain +
. boolean invalid: the token whether valid from keystone, true： invalid  false: valid +
. list<String> roles: the token user role names +

examples: +
{ +
  "token"： “gAAAAABex0sfasdf2234234asdfBSDFREW32324234”， +
  "expireAt": "2020-05-30T16:00:00.000+0000", +
  "user": "neutron", +
  "useId": "10a2e6e717a245d9acad3e5f97aeca3d", +
  "domainId": "default", +
  "domainName": "Default", +
  "projectName": "admin", +
  "projectId": "a6944d763bf64ee6a275f1263fae0352", +
  "projectDomain": "Default", +
  "invalid": false, +
  "roles": ["admin", "demo"] +
}

== Integration Proposal

. Microservice APIs should support multi params query eg: show/list actions
. Rename resource name in url path or add same resource name in url path
. Support "field" params in api and response body should have the "field" params content

== Test Plan

TBD
