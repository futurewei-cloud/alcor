== Overview

Alcor API currently requires a project id in the API Url.Neutron 2.0 APIs, however, don't need to provide a project id as
it generates the project id based on the Authentication token in the X-Auth-Token request header, when Keystone is enabled.

According to <<openstack>>, Neutron's "Networking API v2.0 uses the OpenStack Identity service as the default authentication service.
When Keystone is enabled, users that submit requests to the OpenStack Networking service must provide an authentication
token in X-Auth-Token request header. You obtain the token by authenticating to the Keystone endpoint."

When Keystone is enabled, the project_id attribute is not required in create requests
because the project ID is derived from the authentication token."

[#system-requirements]
=== Integration Requirements

. Identify Neutron's algorithm that generates project id based on X-Auth-Token.
. Make changes to API Gateway to support Authentication & Authorization with KeyStone, and support same way how project id is generated based on X-Auth-Token in API Gateway.
. Integration testing with KeyStone.

=== Review of OpenStack Workflow

In OpenStack neutron project, it uses keystonemiddle to verify request token. <<keystone>>

Verification of request token includes the following steps:
. Get available keystone endpoints from keystone server;
. Request local token from keystone server with keystone client conf in neutron.conf;
. Verify request token from keystone server.

== Proposed Changes

. Add a KeystoneAuthWebFilter class to fetch all api-gateway request token and verify token from keystone server and get project_id from verify api response.
. Add keystone conf in application.properties file (https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/user/supported_clients.html[keystone config example])

=== Token Cache Design

Consider multi requests of one customer might use the same token, it's not needed to send a request to keystone to verify the same token for every request.
A cache component can cache all verified token.
Alcor will check cache first to see if the customer request token has been verified.
If cache has the customer token, it will return token info.
Otherwise, it will send a request to keystone and check response and cache the token result.

A cache data have an expired time to clear no use cache tokens.
Double the token expiration as the cache expiration time.
This can prevent customer request from still carrying expired tokens for verification.

== Data Schema

The token information is saved in a K-V store.
The key is token itself, and the details of the token entity is as follows:

[width="100%",cols="22%,12%,50%"]
|===
|Field Name |Type |Description

|token
|String
|string token

|expireAt
|Date
|the date which token expire at

|user
|String
|the token user name

|userId
|String
|the token user id

|domainId
|String
|the token user domain id

|domainName
|String
|the token user domain name

|projectName
|String
|the token project name

|projectId
|String
|the token project id

|projectDomain
|String
|the token project domain

|invalid
|boolean
|the token whether valid from keystone, true： invalid  false: valid

|roles
|List<String>
|the token user role names

examples:
....
{
  "token"： “gAAAAABex0sfasdf2234234asdfBSDFREW32324234”，
  "expireAt": "2020-05-30T16:00:00.000+0000",

  "domainName": "Default",
  "projectName": "admin",
  "projectId": "a6944d763bf64ee6a275f1263fae0352",
  "projectDomain": "Default",
  "invalid": false,
  "roles": ["admin", "demo"]
}
....



== Test Plan

. Use unit tests to test whether basic functions are faulty.
. Test whether there is a problem with the simulated Keystone environment test.
. Test whether the function integrated into the running OpenStack environment is normal.
. Deploy multiple API gateway instance and test that scenarios.
