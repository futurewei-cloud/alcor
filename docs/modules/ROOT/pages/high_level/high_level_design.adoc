# Alcor - A Hyperscale Cloud-Native SDN Control Plane

NOTE: This document is under development

== Introduction

Shared-nothing Micro-service Architecture

* Micro-services design
** Each micro-service has its dedicated responsibility (e,g, allocating virtual IPs, virtual MACs) and provides gRPC apis for service access
* Shared-nothing architecture
** Database shards, cache and memory are owned by a service, and are not allowed to share across service boundary
* Shared-nothing architecture brings the following benefits:
** Eliminates contention of storage among services
** Reduce cache miss rate and hot cache removal due to noisy neighbors
** Each service could scale on its own by adding new instances, cache instance and database tables
** No single point of failure issue since there is no central resource bottleneck in the system


== Alcor Platform Key Feature Design

=== Large Scale

* Support 1 M VM/containers with MQ layer and batch processing
* Ability to process (potentially thousands) Goal State configuration in big batch for customers

=== High Throughput

* Target is 10K VM/container provisioning per minute

=== Ultra-low Latency
Fast provisioning: One-layer controller design with Goal State push model and fast path

* Using gRPC for super-fast goal state update for certain customer scenarios like serverless
* Goal state model consisting of network resource state and operation type,
grouping of network configurations and instantaneous provisioning

=== Unified VM/container networking management

=== Support agility and velocity in DevOps
* Sidecar model: decouple application and service governance in independent processes, across-language and upgrade decouple
* Services could be updated independently due to service decoupling
* Canary-based grey release

=== Resilience

* Controller AZ resilience

* Communication channel resilience
** gRPC-based fast path
** MQ-based normal path (support Apache Pulsar, Kafka)
** Rescue path (skip local crashed agent and call neighbor agent to pass network configuration)

=== Compatibility

* Compatibility with OpenStack, Kubernetes, and OPNFV
* Support multiple data plane implementations including Mizar (eBPF/Geneve) currently and OVS/VxLan (in design)
** Open driver framework at Controllers
** Plugin model at Alcor Control Agent
