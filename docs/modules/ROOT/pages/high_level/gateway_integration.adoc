== Overview

In today's data center network architectures, many business processes require to traverse various network domains, e.g.,
from one VPC to the other, from DC network to on-premise, from VPC internal to Internet, or vice verse.
Customer VMs under different tenants or network domains need to communicate seamless across these boundaries.
To enable these customer scenarios, SDN-based gateways are widely used in existing DC networks
to link individual network endpoints, perform source or destination network address translation (SNAT),
or build virtual tunnel endpoint (VTEP) to bridge various tunneling technologies such as VxLan and VLAN.

Typical SDN-based gateways (GW) include Internet GW, NAT GW, VPC virtual routers, VPN GW, ExpressRoute GW, and among others.
A common requirement is that a cloud networking management/control plane such as Alcor needs to
drive network configurations or customer-specific configurations to a gateway based on customer scenario
so that gateways could handle traffic sent to/from customer VMs.
The purpose of this document is to outline general requirements and workflows for Alcor to integrate with SDN gateways.
As the first step, we will focus on the integration with Zeta GW.

== Service Requirements

[arabic]
. As an SDN gateway are related to a specific data plane implementation, the integration logics is handled by
Data-Plane Manager (DPM).
. DPM adopts a plug-in model to support various SDN gateways. Each SDN gateway is handled by one separate DPM plugin.
. Other Alcor microservices including all resource management microservices are agnostic to a specific gateway implementation.
For example, when creating a port, Port Manager doesn't need to know the new port is a regular port plumbed into a compute node,
or a port with gateway enabled.

== Design of Key Worfklows

This section outline three key workflows in gateway-related integration, namely, VPC creation, Port creation and
Gateway cluster maintenance.
Each workflow includes at least one proposal and compare the pros and cons of each proposal.

=== VPC Creation

=== Port Creation

Proposal B:

=== Gateway Cluster Maintenance
