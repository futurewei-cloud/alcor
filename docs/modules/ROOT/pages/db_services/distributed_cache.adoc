== Cache Pattern
* Write-back/write-behind cache (w/ Ignite native persistence)
. Data is written to cache along, and completion is immediately confirmed to the client. The write to the permanent storage is performed asynchronously after specified intervals or under certain conditions.
. This results in low-latency and high-throughput for write-intensive applications; however, this speed comes with the risk of data loss in case of a crash or other adverse event because the only copy of the written data is in the cache.
. The key concept of this approach is to accumulate updates and asynchronously flush them to the underlying database as a bulk operation.
* Read/Write-through (w/ external storage) or Write-behind mode
. Read-through means that the data is read from the underlying persistent store if it is not available in the cache.
. Write-through means that the data is automatically persisted when it is updated in the cache. All read-through and write-through operations participate in cache transactions and are committed or rolled back as a whole.
* All-in-Cache (no eviction)

== Cache Configuration
* Cache Mode (describe how data is set is divided into partitions and all partitions are split between participating nodes in a balanced manner)
. _PARTITIONED_ mode is the most scalable distributed cache mode, write is cheaper and suitable for write-intensive caches
. REPLICATED mode offers the highest availability (as it replicates all the data of every partition to every node in the cluster) and suitable for read-intensive caches (80% read)
* Leverage affinity colocation
* Use ACID-compliant transaction to group multiple cache operations (across cache and on multiple keys)

== Memory Configuration
* Stored in unit of pages in managed off-heap RAM region
* Eviction Policy: Random LRU

== Persistence Configuration
* Requirement: capable of surviving crashes or restarts
** Option 1: Ignite native persistence
** Option 2: external database (MySQL, Postgre SQL, SQL Server)
