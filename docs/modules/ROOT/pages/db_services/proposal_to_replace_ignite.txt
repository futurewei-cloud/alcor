Overview

In view of stability, performance and useability problems presented by Ignite a search for a better alternative is in order. This document captures crucial properties of a few alternatives, these properties are hoped to solve the current variety with Ignite and not introduce some new problems of their own.

1) RocksDB

RocksDB is a very good KV, used by many other open/closed source projects and products as the storage engine.

Strengths:

a. Implementation in C++. No Garbage collection related issues.

b. Solid and stable implementation, used by many products as storage engine.

c. Good performance

d. Optimized for SSD

e. Embedded mode.


Weaknesses:

a. The interface is very low level forcing the user code to know and use locks, iterators, key comparators etc.,

b. No support for secondary key access. Search will be fast only when search is on the key fields. All other searches will use linear search, slower.

c. No support for automatic Replication. This affects availability, the application will be forced to deal with failovers by application managed replication.

d. Not a distributed system thus not horizontally scalable.

2) ArangoDB

3) RethinkDB

4) HazelCast

5) *** RavenDB: restricted free
