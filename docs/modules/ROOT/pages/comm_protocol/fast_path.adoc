== Introduction

A fast-provisioning and scalable network control plane is the core of a competitive public cloud offering.
Such a feature would require an instantaneous delivery of networking configurations driven from a region-level Network Controller to Control Agents deployed at every server host of a data center.
Due to the scale of data centers, which can range from a couple hundred thousand to a few million machines, a message queue subsystem (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ) or a multi-layer hierarchy system is usually adopted
as a high-throughput and scalable solution for network configuration updates in the data center.
However, this approach would introduce excessive latency in E2E message delivery.
For example, in the case of handling 100,000s messages, the additional latency by Kafka would be 2-3 _ms_ <<kafka_benchmark,1 >>, <<kafka_benchmark2, 2>>.

The infrastructure limitation does not fit into some customer scenarios when ultra-low latency for E2E network configuration provisioning (in a few 10 _ms_ or 100 _ms_) is a critical requirement.
For example, the emerging serverless platforms and services like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions advertise low latency number of ~100 _ms_, as a major selling point.
Lengthy cold start time or scale-out time harm customer experience <<serverless_limit,3>>, and
the current workaround is simply keeping containers in a warm state by regularly sending events to serverless functions.
In order to provide a competitive fast-provisioning solution with our new CloudFabric Networking platform, it would be necessary to build a control plane fast path to significantly reduce the E2E provisioning time.

The main idea in this proposal is a Kafka bypass that utilizes a gRPC-based direct message channel.
This channel would run between the Network Controllers and the Control Agents.
gRPC has been shown to have low latency of 150-300 _μs_ in the case of handling 100,000s message <<gRPC_benchmark,4>>.
This is a 10x improvement compared to Kafka.
With this fast path, time-critical applications will benefit from the low latency of the gRPC protocol.

== Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the architecture of the network control plane fast path,
and the bi-directional communication channel between the Network Controllers and Control Agents.

=== Bi-directional Communication Channel
The top-down communication channel from Controllers to Agents can be used in many scenarios which require low E2E latency for network configuration update:

. Serverless application: Reduce the instantiation time of containers in which customers' code is running, and shorten waiting times of serverless function invokation.
Either for the first time, or after having its configuration altered/serverless function scale outs.

. Differentiated services: Provide certain SLAs on service provisioning time for premium customers who are willing to pay more to get SLB-backed services.

On the other hand, the bottom-up communication channel from Agents to Controllers could serve as a feedback channel to provide the following.

. Clear status message (e.g., transit switch programming is done
so that Controllers may finalize endpoint host programming and give the green light for the host to start sending packets.
. Actionable error situation (e.g. transit daemon down)

Later on, we could also consider using the fast path for network health monitoring of transit Daemon/switch/router as well as local host networking components.

=== Retry and Fallback Mechanisms

To improve system stability, a client-side retry and fallback mechanism will be supported to overcome transient failures of gRPC servers,
corrupted network connection or momentary loss of network connectivity.
Possible server failures include temporary unavailability of a host node (e.g., host OS crash or restart),
service unavailability of Control Agents or Network Controllers, or timeouts due to busy servers.
When a failure occurs first, a gRPC client can retry the failing request immediately.
If the request still fails, the client makes a few more attempts until a configurable maximum number of requests have been attempted.
Then if the request remains unsuccessful, the client can fall back to the normal path by sending message to the Kafka cluster.

=== Idempotent gRPC APIs

By design, gRPC allows both the client and server to make independent and local decision of the success of the call.
This means that the state on the client and server could be inconsistent,
which could potentially cause an issue when a RPC call finishes successfully on the server side while fails on the client side.

To address the above issue, the gRPC service APIs in both Network Agent and Network Controller are all idempotent.
We support idempotent operations including Create, Update, Read and Delete on network resources.
There is no additional effect if any service API is called more than once with the same input parameter(s).
For example, if the Network Controller calls the same Control Agent twice and attempts to create one identical port, the second call should return SUCCESS and introduce no additional effect.


//=== Client Hedging to Reduce Tail Latency

//=== Secure Channels via SSL/TLS
//A gRPC channel are secure by default via SSL/TLS until TLS is disabled for debugging or other purposes.


== Contract between Controller and Agent

The service APIs and the format of messages exchanged between the Control Agents and Network Controllers for the top-down channel is as follows:

=== Service APIs

*src/schema/proto3/goalstateprovisioner.proto*

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------
syntax = "proto3";

package aliothcontroller;

option java_package = "com.futurewei.alioth.controller.service";

import "common.proto";
import "goalstate.proto";

service GoalStateProvisioner {

   // Push a group of network resource states
   //
   // Input: a GoalState object consists of a list of operation requests, and each request contains an
   //        operation type and a resource configuration
   // Results consist of a list of operation statuses, and each status is a response to one operation
   //        request in the input
   //
   // Note: It is a NoOps for Control Agents when the operation type is INFO or GET.
   //       Use RetrieveNetworkResourceStates for state query.
   rpc PushNetworkResourceStates(GoalState) returns (GoalStateOperationReply) {}


   // Retrieve a group of network resource states (stored in a GoalState object)
   rpc RetrieveNetworkResourceStates(GoalStateRequest) returns (GoalState) {}
}
------------------------------------------------------------


=== Message Exchanged Between Agent and Controller

* Goal state message.
The goal state message allows any combination of VpcState, SubnetState, PortState and SecurityGroupState, and grouping of them.
For example, one message could consists of one subnet state update with 1000 ports creation to a data-plane switch, or two VPC update to a single VM/container host.

*src/schema/proto3/goalstate.proto*

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------
syntax = "proto3";

package aliothcontroller;

option java_package = "com.futurewei.alioth.controller.schema";

import "vpc.proto";
import "subnet.proto";
import "port.proto";
import "securitygroup.proto";

message GoalState {
   repeated VpcState vpc_states = 1;
   repeated SubnetState subnet_states = 2;
   repeated PortState port_states = 3;
   repeated SecurityGroupState security_group_states = 4;
}
------------------------------------------------------------

* VpcState message.
OperationType includes CREATE, UPDATE, GET, DELETE, INFO, FINALIZE, CREATE_UPDATE_SWTICH, CREATE_UPDATE_ROUTER to cover various scenarios in network resource CURD operations.

*src/schema/proto3/vpc.proto*

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------
syntax = "proto3";

package aliothcontroller;

option java_package = "com.futurewei.alioth.controller.schema";
option java_outer_classname = "Vpc";

import "common.proto";

message VpcState {
  OperationType operation_type = 1;
  VpcConfiguration configuration =  2;
}

------------------------------------------------------------


* VpcConfiguration message

[source,java]
------------------------------------------------------------
syntax = "proto3";

package aliothcontroller;

option java_package = "com.futurewei.alioth.controller.schema";
option java_outer_classname = "Vpc";

import "common.proto";

message VpcConfiguration {
  int32 version = 1;

  string project_id = 2;
  string id  = 3;
  string name = 4;
  string cidr = 5;
  int64 tunnel_id = 6;

  message SubnetId {
    string id = 1;
  }

  message Route {
    string destination = 1;
    string next_hop = 2;
  }

  message TransitRouter {
    string vpc_id = 1;
    string ip_address = 2;
    string mac_address = 3;
  }

  repeated SubnetId subnet_ids = 7;
  repeated Route routes = 8;
  repeated TransitRouter transit_routers = 9;
}
------------------------------------------------------------
