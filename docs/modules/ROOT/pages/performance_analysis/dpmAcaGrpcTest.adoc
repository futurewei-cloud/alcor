. *Test step:*

F send goal state message to A-E at the same time concurrently after first warming up then wait for the response, goal state message is different in each payload

On A-E there are 2600 ACA running on each box, ACA code has been revised to cut off the ovsdb and mq operations

. *Test Conclusion*

[loweralpha]
. *Alcor DataPlane Manager could support more than 10k concurrent ACA grpc requests*
. *Alcor DataPlane Manager runs well when from 32 threads up to 256 threads for the performance*
. *A-E hardware configuration could run 2000 stable ACA instances on each box*

[arabic, start=6]
. *Problems for now*

[arabic]

[arabic, start=1]
. *ALCOR CONTROL AGENT crash after several heavy test*

Syslog does not say error on ALCOR CONTROL AGENT

[arabic, start=2]
. *io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNAVAILABLE: Network closed for unknown reason*

After reduce load on A-E, this issue is gone
